For Developer Portal to display correct authentication information which configured by 3Scale. Paramater named "x-data-threescale-name" need to be added.

```
...
"parameters": [
          {
                    "name": "user-key",
                    "in": "header",
                    "description": "Your API access key",
                    "required": true,
                    "x-data-threescale-name": "user_keys",
                    "type": "string"
                }
         
        ],
...
```

Swagger's host and scheme also needed to be modified according to your protocol and route host name.

```
...
"schemes": [
    "https"
  ],
  "host": "catalog-service-production-apicast-ocp20.apps.4865.open.redhat.com:443",
...
```

By default, Developer Portal show only the 1st API docs. New partial [swagger-ui-partial.liquid](liquid/swagger-ui-partial.liquid)  is created to support for display multiple OpenAPI/Swagger doc.

Modified original Documentation pages to include above partail.
